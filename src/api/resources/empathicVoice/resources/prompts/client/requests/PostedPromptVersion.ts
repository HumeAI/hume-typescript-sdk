   * Instructions used to shape EVIâ€™s behavior, responses, and style for this version of the Prompt.
   *
   * You can use the Prompt to define a specific goal or role for EVI, specifying how it should act or what it should focus on during the conversation. For example, EVI can be instructed to act as a customer support representative, a fitness coach, or a travel advisor, each with its own set of behaviors and response styles.
