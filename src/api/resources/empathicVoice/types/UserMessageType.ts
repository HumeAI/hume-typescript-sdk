 * The type of message sent through the socket; for a User Message, this must be `user_message`.
 *
 * This message contains both a transcript of the user's input and the expression measurement predictions if the input was sent as an [Audio Input message](/reference/speech-to-speech-evi/chat#send.AudioInput). Expression measurement predictions are not provided for a [User Input message](/reference/speech-to-speech-evi/chat#send.UserInput), as the prosody model relies on audio input and cannot process text alone.
