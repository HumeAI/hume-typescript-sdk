 * **Transcript of the user's message.** Contains the message role and content, along with a `from_text` field indicating if this message was inserted into the conversation as text from a `UserInput` message.

 * Includes an `interim` field indicating whether the transcript is provisional (words may be repeated or refined in subsequent `UserMessage` responses as additional audio is processed) or final and complete. Interim transcripts are only sent when the `verbose_transcription` query parameter is set to true in the initial handshake.
